### IV.3. Appendix - Potential Future Enhancements

While the current BQOMIS frontend implements a robust set of core features, several enhancements could be considered for future iterations to further improve functionality, user experience, and technical architecture.

**A. Client-Facing Enhancements:**

1.  **Real-Time Queue Updates & Notifications:**
    *   Implement WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) to provide clients with real-time updates on their queue position after check-in.
    *   Push notifications (web or mobile if a PWA/native app is considered) for appointment reminders, when their turn is approaching, or for status changes.
2.  **Profile Picture Upload:**
    *   Allow clients to upload and manage their profile pictures instead of just a placeholder.
    *   Requires backend storage (e.g., S3) and an upload endpoint.
3.  **Service Ratings & Feedback:**
    *   Allow clients to rate services or provide feedback after an appointment is completed.
4.  **Branch Details Page:**
    *   A dedicated page for each branch showing more details: map location, full operating hours (if dynamic), contact information, photos, specific amenities.
5.  **Advanced Appointment Search/Filtering (Client-Side):**
    *   Allow clients to search their "My Appointments" list by service name, branch, or date range.
6.  **Multi-Language Support (i18n):**
    *   Implement internationalization to support multiple languages in the UI.
7.  **Accessibility (WCAG) Enhancements:**
    *   Conduct a thorough accessibility audit and implement improvements to meet WCAG AA or AAA standards (more ARIA attributes, enhanced keyboard navigation, focus management).
8.  **Progressive Web App (PWA) Features:**
    *   Add a service worker, manifest file, and other PWA capabilities for offline access (e.g., viewing booked appointments) and "add to home screen" functionality.
9.  **Passwordless Login Options:**
    *   Consider magic links or social logins (Google, etc.) for alternative authentication methods.

**B. Admin-Facing Enhancements:**

1.  **Full CRUD "Update" Functionality:**
    *   Complete the "Edit/Update" API calls and frontend logic for Branch Management, Service Management, and User Management.
2.  **Advanced User Management:**
    *   Admin-initiated password resets for users.
    *   Ability to activate/deactivate user accounts.
    *   Audit logs for user actions.
3.  **Advanced Appointment Management:**
    *   Ability for admins to reschedule appointments on behalf of clients (complex, involves finding new slots).
    *   Bulk actions on appointments (e.g., bulk status updates).
4.  **More Sophisticated Analytics & Reporting:**
    *   Export analytics data (CSV, PDF).
    *   More chart types and customizable dashboards.
    *   Drill-down capabilities in charts.
    *   Alerts for specific KPI thresholds (e.g., unusually long wait times).
5.  **Branch Operating Hours Management:**
    *   Allow admins to define default operating hours and then override them per branch, including special holiday hours. This would make the time slot generation more dynamic and accurate.
6.  **Resource Management (Staff Allocation):**
    *   Assign staff members to specific services or branches.
    *   (Very Advanced) Link appointment availability to staff availability for particular services.
7.  **Customizable Email/Notification Templates:**
    *   Allow admins to edit the content of automated emails (confirmations, reminders) sent by the system.
8.  **Audit Trail for Admin Actions:**
    *   Log significant actions performed by administrators for security and accountability.

**C. Technical & Architectural Enhancements:**

1.  **Dedicated Data Fetching/Caching Library:**
    *   Integrate React Query (TanStack Query) or SWR for more robust server state management, caching, automatic refetching, and optimistic updates. This can significantly improve UI responsiveness and reduce redundant API calls.
2.  **State Management Review:**
    *   If global state complexity increases beyond `AuthContext` and simple settings, consider a more structured global state management solution like Zustand or Recoil for specific shared states.
3.  **Comprehensive Unit and Integration Testing:**
    *   Increase test coverage using libraries like Jest and React Testing Library.
4.  **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:**
    *   Implement E2E tests with Cypress or Playwright for critical user flows.
5.  **Code Splitting and Performance Optimization:**
    *   Further optimize bundle sizes using route-based code splitting and lazy loading of components.
    *   Image optimization.
6.  **Storybook for Component Development:**
    *   Use Storybook to develop and document UI components in isolation, improving reusability and testing.
7.  **GraphQL (Alternative API Layer):**
    *   For very complex data fetching requirements or to give the frontend more control over the data it requests, consider exploring GraphQL as an alternative or addition to REST APIs for certain parts of the application.
8.  **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):**
    *   Automate testing and deployment pipelines.

These potential enhancements range from small UX improvements to significant architectural changes. Prioritization would depend on evolving business requirements, user feedback, and resource availability. The current foundation is designed to be extensible to accommodate many of these future developments.
